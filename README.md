# Deep-Learning-Datasets-to-Remind-Later:
  I've opened this repo to note and share good datasets I've seen by participating projects, reading papers, following tutorials etc. I put datasets & related codes especially I've not found on general platforms like Kaggle. Hopefully,in the future, this repo will help me and who reads it to build similar projects faster.
  
### My general experiments about datasets:
(The codes I wrote to learn tensorflow-keras-pytorch dataset related classes & functions.)
* [Building tensorflow textline dataset objects](https://www.kaggle.commy-tf-data-experiments)
